final-project-weather-web-app created by Group 10

    Weather website where the homepage would change depending on the hour of the day for both the forecast and
    background (bright blue midday but a blackish color at night). If we use an api we could get the user's location
    via a ZIP code and display the weather information for their area.I think the best way to implement this would be to 
    get the users data and then display the page with their location set, if they wish to change there’d be a button to get 
    their information again. We could store the user’s location in a cookie so if they revisit their location would not change. 
    If we need more pages we could implement a week forecast or a 3/4 day forecast.https://openweathermap.org/api is an example
    of an open source api. We’d need to ask the instructor first if it is alright for us to use an api.
