# Weather-web-app

** final-project-weather-web-app created by Group 10: kooske, laik, engbergt.**
** CS290 - Web Development**
The idea we went with is Kevin's, to build a weather web-app that shows temperatures of user-saved locations with their main location showing a simple forecast for the day.
We used this API for weather data: https://openweathermap.org/api
